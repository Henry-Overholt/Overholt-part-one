# Overholt-part-one

My name is Henry Overholt. 
This project is one of two projects that I did as pre-work to get into a coding bootcamp at Grand-Circus.
This was the first time I ever coded any project.
I had no idea what I was doing, but it was so much fun.
It was tough, but the moment it works it was pure joy.
The project was to copy a design with HTML and CSS. 
It needed to be responsive, and that was a challenge but it lead me down a magical road of Flex-blox.

If you are reading this, and are new to programming and you are having trouble with flex-blox, you should go to https://flexboxfroggy.com/
I did to understand and practice flex-box.
